        <p>
          &#128073; In Html, for example, the
          <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> element is a semantic element , which
          gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning of "a top level
          heading on your page")
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary><mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></summary>
        </details>
        <p>
          &#128073; By default, most browsers user agent stylesheet will style
          an <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> with alarge font size to make it
          look like a heading ( although you could style it to look like
          anytjing you wanted ) an the othe hand, you could make any element
          look like a top level heading.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary><mark>Consider the following</mark></summary>
        </details>
        <p>
          &#10154; This will render it to like a top level heading, but is has
          no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benfits as described
          above. It is therefore a good idea to used to use the right HTML
          element for the right job.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#10154; HTML should be coded to represent the data that will bwe
          poulated and not based on its default presentation styling.
          Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.
